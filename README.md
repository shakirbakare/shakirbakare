Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Peace be upon you!

My name is Shakir Bakare. I'm a front-end engineer and technical writer from Lagos, Nigeria. I'm passionate about creating seamless user experiences using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass, and React.

You can check out my portfolio at [shakirbakare.github.io](http://shakirbakare.github.io/).

I write in simple language on my Hashnode blog "<a href='https://shakirbakare.hashnode.dev'>DOCS BY SHAKIR</a>" to make complex development concepts easy to understand for myself and other developers.

I am looking to collaborate on open-source front-end development and technical writing projects.
